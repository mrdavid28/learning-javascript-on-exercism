I was learning javascript on Exercism by doing exercises on the javascript learning track. I didn't write all this from scratch, I copied the folders with the exercise that need to be solved from the Exercism platform using commands, here is an example: exercism download --track=javascript --exercise=windowing-system. While solving tasks on the learning path, I am learning the basics of JavaScript. When I didn't get stuck and didn't know how to solve a problem, I was looking at other users' solutions, so not everything here is my code.
